# 🐍 Python Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Python Learning Repository** — a collection of lab tasks, exercises, and learning resources created during my university Python course. This repository documents my journey from basics to more advanced topics as part of lab assignments and self-study. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains:

- 📚 **Python Labs & Assignments** — organized by lab number.
- 🧠 **Concept Notebooks** — focus on Python fundamentals such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, and more.
- 🧪 **Jupyter Notebooks** — interactive code examples and exercises.
- 💡 **Practice Files** — practice scripts used alongside YouTube learning and course materials.

This repo supports both classroom learning and self-directed study to reinforce Python programming skills.
